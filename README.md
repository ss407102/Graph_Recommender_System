# Graph_Recommender_System
With the help of patients previous medical history we have to predict from which disease patient is gonna suffer in coming days and so by doing this we will be able to tell the patient to take better mediction related to that disease and so we will be able to save patient and also cost of their treatment.
    Data Consists of 30000 patients and 47364 diseases (ICD Codes) and total 3021969 edges and contains adjacency matrix mat where mat(I,J) = 1 if there is edge between patient i and disease J else mat(I,J) = 0. Result is Based on 5 different models Graph Convolutional Network, Graph Sage , Simplified Graph Convolutional Network , Variational Graph Autoencoder , Matrix Factorization.
